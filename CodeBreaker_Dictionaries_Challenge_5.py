# Create program that will encode or decode a secret message 
# based off a letter distribution (see previous Challenge 4 Letter Frequency Distribution program) of a pre-determined key text
# Determine the frequency analysis of two texts 
# And use the letter distributions to create a cypher
# to either encode or decode a text string entered by user
# 
# No longer asked to enter key phrase, instead use pre-determined key phrase
# 
# Analyze both phrases
# Decide if encoding or decoding
# Enter phrase
# Show encoded message and copy it
# Then rerun program and select decode and decode that message
# Verify that it matches original message
